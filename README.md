# Titanic_API

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to understand how to productionize a machine learning model using Flask and Postman. This was done in primarily in the model.py and app.py files. 

## Steps Taken

In the jupyter notebook file, you can explicitly see the steps taken for data cleaning and for splitting hte data. The measurements of multiple classification models were used to test which model predicted best on passengers that would survive the titanic crash.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine

Gradient Boosting Classifier
