# Titanic_API

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to understand how to productionize a machine learning model using Flask and Postman. This was done in primarily in the model.py and app.py files. 

## Steps Taken

In the jupyter notebook file, you can explicitly see the steps taken for data cleaning and for splitting the data. The measurements of multiple classification models were used to test which model predicted best on passengers that would survive the titanic crash.

Using VS Code, the model.py, app.py, and model.pkl files were run via Flask. The localhost created via Flask was then connected to Postman in order to create new predictions on new data.
